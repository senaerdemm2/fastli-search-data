# fastli-search-data

##  Project Objective
This project was initiated to scrape and analyze job listings from FASTLI.PL. 
Note: Currently, the site contains very few listings (only 6), so trend and seasonality analyses can not be performed.

- fastli_clean.csv → Sample dataset in CSV format  
- scraper.ipynb → Scraping code (Jupyter Notebook)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository bash
git clone https://github.com/senaerdemm2/fastli-search-data.git

 2.Open Jupyter Lab

 3.Run scraper.ipynb to fetch the data again if needed
